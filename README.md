# pf2e-cantrip-rebalance
A homebrew rebalance of PF2E post-remaster damaging cantrips.

## Goals

- Make each cantrip viable (that means, at minimum competitive with Electric Arc) in at least some situations
- Make a more fair, consistent tradeoff for save (half damage on Success) vs attack roll (0 damage when you miss) cantrips
- Re-introduce 120ft range cantrips and increase the number of them

## Quick Summary

1. Multi-target saves (Electric Arc) - 2d4 + 1d4 (Heightened), 30ft range
2. Multi-target attacks (Slashing Gust) - 2d4 + 1d4 (Heightened), 60ft range
3. Single-target saves (Frostbite) - 2d6 + 1d6 (Heightened), 60ft range
4. Single-target attacks (Needle Darts) - 2d6 + 1d6 (Heightened), 120ft range
5. Melee multi-target saves (Gale Blast) - 2d4 + 1d4 (Heightened)
6. Melee single-target (Gouging Claw) - 2d6 + 1d6 (Heightened) plus persistent
